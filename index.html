		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<p>Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch round cake pan with parchment and spray the interior with a nonstick spray. In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter until smooth. Add the sugars and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and yolk and beat well, then the red wine and vanilla. Don’t worry if the batter looks a little uneven. Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and salt together, right over your wet ingredients. Mix until 3/4 combined, then fold the rest together with a rubber spatula. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. The top of the cake should be shiny and smooth, like a puddle of chocolate. Cool in pan on a rack for about 10 minutes, then flip out of pan and cool the rest of the way on a cooling rack. This cake keeps well at room temperature or in the fridge. It looks pretty dusted with powdered sugar.</p>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="images/headshot.jpg" class="face">
		<h3>Baker, Dog-Lover, Burrito Enthusiast</h3>
		<p>I moved to San Francisco after finishing school at UCSB. I currently work as an Implementation Consultant at Salesforce and volunteer on the board of a non-profit called Girls in Tech. </p>
		<p>I got baking into a year ago, when I made a loaf of bread for my friend Jordan, only to bring it to the office and find out he was gone for the week. I wasn't going to eat all of that bread by myself! So, I put it in the office kitchen and it disappeared fairly quickly - it was nice to have a creation of mine be appreciated. Since then, I try to bake once a week!</p>
